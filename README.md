## >> Project Name:

noteful-app--api-heroku

## >> Project Summary:

This assignment converts local version of Noteful server [Noteful-Server--Express-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/davetam88/Noteful-Server--Express-PostgreSQL) and deploy it to Heroku server so that the database content can be exposed via a set of API interfaces.This Server API APP is live at :

[Noteful-API--Heroku - Live link](https://stormy-depths-51799.herokuapp.com/)

The Server APP use PostgreSQL database engine to supplies these APIs.

These API was used by the online version of the Noteful Client [Noteful-Client--React-Router](https://github.com/davetam88/Noteful-Client--React-Router) to emulate a Note management APP. This client app is live at :

[Noteful-Client--React-Router - live link at Vercel](https://noteful-client-test1.vercel.app/)

Integrated test was developed in tandem with API code development by using Mocha(a testing framework), Chai(an assertion library), and Supertest(a tool for testing HTTP calls) to ensure maximum code reliability.

## >> Database

Database noteful and noteful-test were used; noteful_folders and noteful_notes are the database tables.

## >> Supported endpoints(and how the noteful client APP access to these endpoints)

```
> GET /folders = read all the folders in the database
  Access at APP startup

> GET /notes = read all the notes in the database
  Access at APP startup

> POST /folders = create a new noteful folder
  Access with the add folder button of the client app

> POST /notes = create a new noteful note
  Access with the add folder button of the client app

> DELETE /note/id = to delete an individual noteful note
  Access with the delete note button next to the note
```

## >> Screenshots

- Noteful API Server APP - main screen (deploy with Heroku), it is accessing the same folder page data as the client APP shown below using the /folders endpoint API.

# Express Boilerplate!

This is a boilerplate project used for starting new projects!

## Set up

Complete the following steps to start a new project (NEW-PROJECT-NAME):

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
   git clone BOILERPLATE-URL NEW-PROJECTS-NAME
2. `cd` into the cloned repository
3. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with
   rm -rf .git && git init
4. Install the node dependencies
   npm install
5. Move the example Environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server
   mv example.env .env
6. Edit the contents of the `package.json` to use NEW-PROJECT-NAME instead of `"name": "express-boilerplate",`

## Scripts

Start the application
npm start

Start nodemon for the application
npm run dev

Run the tests
npm test

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with
Heroku create
This will make a new git remote called "Heroku" and you can then
npm run deploy
which will push to this remote's main branch.
